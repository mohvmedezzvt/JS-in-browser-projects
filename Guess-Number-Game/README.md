# Guess My Number Game

## Overview

This is a simple number-guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. The player has 20 attempts, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Features

- Random secret number generation.
- Dynamic feedback on guesses.
- Score tracking with the ability to beat the high score.

## Project Structure

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a guess (a number between 1 and 20) in the input field and click "Check!".
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
